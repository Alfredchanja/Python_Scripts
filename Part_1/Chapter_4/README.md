# Chapter_Four: Working With Lists

In this chapter I learned how to work with the elements in a list, how to work through a list using a for loop, and how to avoid some simple indentation errors. I also learned how to make some simple numerical lists and some operations that can make a numerical list. I learned how to slice a list and copy a list properly using a slice. Then I finished with tuples and how to style my code.
