# Chapter_Six: Dictionaries

In this chapter I learned how to define dictionaries and how to work with information stored in dictionaries. How to access and modify individual elements in a dictionary, how to loop through a dictionary and its key_value pairs, its keys, and its values. I also learnes how to nest multiple dictionaries in a list, nest a list in a dictionary, and a dictionary in a dictionary.
