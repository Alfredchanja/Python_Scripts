# Chapter_10: Files and Exceptions

In this Chapter I learned how to work with files. I learned how to read an entire file at once and read through a file's contents one line at a time. I learned to write to a file and append text onto a end of a file. I read about exceptions and how to handle the exceptions and how to store Python data structures so i can save information my user provides, preventing them from having to start over each time they run a program.
