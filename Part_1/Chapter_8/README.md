# Chapter_8: Functions

In this chapter I learned how to write functions and to pass arguments so that functions have access to the information they need to work. I learned how to use positional and keyword arguments. I saw functions that display outputs and those that return values. I learned how to use functions with lists, dictionaries, if statements, and while loops. I also saw how to store my functions in separate files called modules. Then I learned how to style my functions so that my program is well organised.
