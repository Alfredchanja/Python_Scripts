# Chapter_9: Classes

In this program I learned how to write my own classes. I also learned how to store information in a class using attributes and how to write methods that give my classes the behaviour they need. I learned to write __init__() methods. I learned that inheritance can simplify the creation  of classes that are related to each other, and I learned to use instances of one class as attributes in another class to keep each class simple.
