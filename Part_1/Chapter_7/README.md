# Chapter_7: User Input and While loops

In this chapter I learned how to use input() to get some information from the users. I learned how to work with both text and numerical input and how to use the while loops to make programs run as long as user want them to. I learned how to control the flow of the while loop and to use while loop together with lists and dictionaries.
