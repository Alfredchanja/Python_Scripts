#In this program I learn how to convert input numericals from strings to integers using the int() function.

height = input("How tall are you in centimeters: ")
height = int(height)

if height >= 90:
    print("You are old enough to ride the rollercoaster.")
else:
    print("You will beable to ride the rollercoaster when you get a little taller.")
